    -Two police bikes will chase after Bob, one of which swirves slightly after a certain point.
    
  The right tracks riders finish their race heading north.
    -As mentioned in the console, mary is in the process of breaking down, and so is slowing to a stop, just before the finish line.
    -As Mary is coming to a stop, three riders will pass her to win the race.
